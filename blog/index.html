        <h2>Peanut Butter and the Jif That Keeps on Giving</h2>
        <h3 style="font-size:1.25em;color:#444;margin-top:0;">
          A stunning discovery promises to shake up a long-running sticky debate online</h3>
        <p>
          <b>Lexington, Ky.</b> &mdash; In a statement released this week, the estate of William T. Young, creator of the 
          popular Jif peanut butter, announced the discovery of a handwritten diary entry detailing how the brand name 
          was intended to be pronounced. According to the entry, Jif was meant to use a hard "g" sound—"Gif," as in "gift," 
          without the "t." The passage reportedly reflects Young's frustration with early mispronunciations and his desire 
          for a clear, unambiguous brand identity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Following the disclosure, a spokesperson for Procter & Gamble (P&G), the company that currently produces Jif 
          peanut butter, said it is embracing the founder's original intent. In a brief announcement, Damon D. Jones, 
          Chief Communications Officer at P&G, encouraged consumers and advertisers to pronounce the brand name with a 
          hard "g," citing respect for Young's vision and the newly surfaced historical record.
        </p>
        <p>
          The clarification adds an ironic twist to a separate, decades-old linguistic controversy: the pronunciation of 
          the GIF image format. Despite being spelled the same way, the format's creator has long insisted it should be 
          pronounced "Jif," with a soft "g," mirroring the traditional pronunciation of the peanut butter brand.
        </p>
        <p>
          Language experts note that the result is an unusual reversal. Under the newly revealed guidance, Jif peanut 
          butter would now be pronounced "Gif," while GIF images would remain "Jif." "This is a necessary clarification 
          that will simplify conversations moving forward," Jones added.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not everyone agrees. A prominent figure in the technology community, speaking on condition of anonymity, argued 
          that the image format's creator should continue to be honored. The source emphasized that GIF should still be 
          pronounced "Jif," but applying a hard "g" to the image format as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whether the public will adopt the founder's preferred pronunciation remains to be seen. For now, a simple jar 
          of peanut butter has once again proven capable of sparking a surprisingly sticky debate.

        <h2>CSS Balloon</h2>
        <p>
          <a href="/comics/209/">Today's comic</a> is a longer comic than usual, and I was planning on 
          publishing it in a few weeks, but looking at the news cycle, I thought that just as well it 
          could be published now.
        </p>
        <p>
          If it is familiar, it's because it is inspired on a comic strip from 
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearls_Before_Swine_(comics)" rel="externak nofollow">
            Pearls Before Swine (by Stephan Pastis)
          </a>, in which Pig floats away with a balloon after watching the news:
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img src="./images/pearls-balloon.webp" alt="cartoon with a pig inflating a balloon and flying away" />
          <figcaption>Pearls Before Swine comic strip (source and copyright: Stephan Pastis)</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          Pearls Before Swine is a great comic and I've used it as inspiration in the past. 
          Having the component library makes it easier to create comics, and I decided to give it 
          a try at this comic strip, which is one of my favorites.
        </p>
        <p>
          The idea is the same but, as always, just a shadow of what the original conveys. 
          Stephan makes it "positive", while mine may look like the character is jumping from 
          a window or something and have negative connotations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Focusing more on the comic, I always like to include a note of color, in this case the 
          balloon and open sky are perfect for the regular black and white of the panels and characters.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also, this is a cartoon about CSS, so I had to include it somehow: blowing the balloon, 
          it grows using scale (1, 1.1, 1.2...) and the character floats away with a translate: 
          Infinity Infinity... which is technically wrong (in order to go up it would need to be 
          Infinity -Infinity), but we are not going to be picky -not to mention that the Infinity 
          keyword cannot be used by itself (at least not yet) and it would need something like 
          <code>calc()</code>, <code>min()</code>, or <code>max()</code> to work.
        </p>
        <p>I hope you enjoyed the comic as much as I enjoyed coding it.</p>

      <article id="the-old-way-vs-the-new-way">
        <h2>The Old Way vs The New Way</h2>
        <p>
          I finally did it. I created <a href="../library/">a small library</a> that lets me generate 
          this type of cartoons faster, without repeating code (or not as much) and I used it to 
          create next week's comic.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's about doing things the "old way" (lengthier, simpler, craftier) vs the "new way" (more 
          complex, but faster after the fact). And an allegory to the library in itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          Creating comics is now considerably easier, faster, and cleaner... But, at the same time, using 
          HTML5 web components feels like it defeats the purpose of comiCSS a little. It's no longer purely 
          an HTML and CSS project. This is because web components require JavaScript to work, even if they 
          are static (which is kind of ridiculous, but it is what it is.)
        </p>
        <p>
          I "barely" started adding options, and because they compound, there are already <b>over 3,000,000 
          different combinations</b>:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>75 mouths</li>
          <li>25 eyes (working on this currently)</li>
          <li>6 different hairs</li>
          <li>5 different skin tones</li>
          <li>5 different facial hairs</li>
          <li>4 different ears</li>
          <li>3 body types (mainly width, but I'd like to add some shapes too)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Some of them don't play nice with each other, so the number is considerably reduced (while still 
          in the thousands). I have also added props and accessories: tables, computers, notes...
        </p>
        <p>
          As part of the web component, I also added a header with the cartoon title and a footer with the 
          comiCSS motto (slightly modified) and a link to the site (maybe I should add a link to Patreon and 
          other social media platforms.)
        </p>
        <p>
          These cartoons are neat, I hope I keep getting ideas and expanding the library. One concern I 
          have is that I may see it as "complete" and stop drawing them altogether. Something like what 
          happened with the Batman CSS library.

            <li><code>tan()</code>: "tanning" (first panel)</li>
            <li><code>atan2()</code>: "a tan too" (second panel)</li>
            <li><code>cos()</code>: "coz" (second panel, this is phonetic)</li>
            <li><code>sin()</code>: "sinus" (second panel)</li>
            <li><code>acos()</code>: "such a cost" (third panel)</li>
            <li><code>asin()</code>: "a sin" (third panel)</li>
            <li><code>atan()</code>: "a tangerine" (third panel)</li>
            <li><code>hypot()</code>: "hypothesis" (fourth panel)</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            This last one is not necessarily a trigonometric function, but a generic math 
            one. Yet, with that name, I'll count it as one.

          Were you able to find them?

        <h2>CSS, Colors, and JavaScript</h2>
        <p>
          Some may say that if you have to explain a joke, then it is not really funny... I prefer to see it as a little 
          <em>educational</em> opportunity. So here's a short story about colors, links, and JavaScript.
        </p>
        <p>
          CSS is the domain of styling, layout, and colors &mdash;this last one being a feature that has expanded immensely in 
          recent years. But did you know that JavaScript can read those styles, too? The <code>getComputedStyle</code> method 
          can be used to retrieve the final computed styles for a given element: margins, paddings, backgrounds, colors... or 
          mostly. There are some limitations, mainly due to security reasons, and <a href="/comics/187/">today's cartoon</a>
          explores that.
        </p>
        <p>
          By default, browsers display links in blue, and after being visited, they show them in purple. JavaScript being able 
          to detect these color changes could become a privacy risk. For example, a hacker could generate a list of links, make 
          a user visit the page, and then check which links have already been visited, essentially revealing the user's browsing 
          history.
        </p>
        <p>
          To prevent this, the <code>getComputedStyle</code> method will always return the default styles for a link, even if it 
          has been visited. That way, attackers will not be able to detect if a link is purple and they won't be able to find out 
          if the person's browsing behavior.
        </p>
        <p>
          Anyway, that's why CSS sees the link purple while JS still sees it blue. I hope you enjoyed the comic and, maybe, learned
          something new about CSS and JavaScript. And if you want to learn more about the <code>getComputedStyle</code> method, 
          check out the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/getComputedStyle" rel="external nofollow">MDN

        <h2>Everything is CSS</h2>
        <p>
          I originally published this cartoon on April 15, 2025. At the tme, I was reading
          John Green's book "Everything is Tuberculosis" and I was really enjoying it... 
          so, in between chapters, I took a stab at recreating the cover with a CSS twist.

          The result is <a href="/comics/184">today's comic</a>.

          All the CSS is coming out!

        <p>
          ...Except the demos, sorry, they are still in CSS. I know it's cheating,
          but the demos have the CSS embedded on the page instead of linking to an external CSS file. 
          So removing the CSS for the demos would be a big pain in the neck.

        <h2>"Political" content</h2>
        <p>
          I just posted some "political" cartoons, that are done in CSS (as usual), but they touch on
          topics that are not necessarily related to CSS (even when they are CSS theme). They are more
          related to current events and, because of that, they'll lose meaning with time as people 
          forget about them.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is a description for future reference of the cartoons. Maybe more of a reminder for me as
          to why I did them.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <a href="/comics/176">I was secretly added to a CSS security Signal chat</a>. The top people in
            charge of the US defense were caught having sensitive information communications on Signal. It was
            revealed by a <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/03/trump-administration-accidentally-texted-me-its-war-plans/682151/" rel="external nofollow">
            journalist they added to the conversation <em>by mistake</em></a>. One of the participants
            replied to a comment with just three emojis that became a meme: 👊🇺🇸🔥. I just replaced the US 
            flag with the CSS logo.
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="/comics/177">Vibe Coding Keyboard</a>. The latest trend (fad?) in programming (or more 
            accurately in technology) is "vibe coding." It is coding without coding. Telling an AI what you 
            want to build, and it builds it for you. Unfortunately for the vibe coders, right now the results 
            have been mixed. The comic is a keyboard with a single Tab button, which is not necessarily vibe 
            coding (using voice), but we won't get too picky. <a href="https://medium.com/gitconnected/microsoft-announces-a-revolutionary-keyboard-designed-for-vibe-coding-0a7a4290bc3a">I wrote an April Fool's article 
            based on this cartoon</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="/comics/178">Tariffs</a>. The US government is imposing tariffs on China, and basically 
            almost every other country in the world based on the import deficit. And what web languages have 
            imports in them? JavaScript and CSS! So I made it into a fake news article with the headline about 
            JS tariffs. Silly but obvious.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Anyway, I hope I won't have to regret these comics and that they end up being forgotten. That will mean 
          that the news that look important now were not so impactful after all... We'll see.

        <h2>#DECAFF #C0FFEE at 200 Degrees</h2>
        <p>
          Sometimes the CSS jokes write themselves, and they aren't even jokes but they actually look 
          good.
        </p>
        <p>
          One example of this is writing words with hexadecimal colors. We can use the letters A, B, C, 
          D, E, and F; and then use the numbers 0 for an O, and maybe the number 1 for an I, and 5 for 
          an S... although that would be stretching it a little.
        </p>
        <p>
          With that in mind, <code>#DECAFF</code> is a valid hex color (light purple), and 
          <code>#C0FFEE</code> is also a valid hex color (a light aquamarine). Creating a gradient
          from one to another at 200 degrees actually makes for a great looking background.
        </p>
        <p>
          Which is <em>funny</em> considering that the ideal temperature for coffee is 200 degrees
          Farenheit (or 90 degrees Celsius.) Anyway. Just some silly decaffeinated CSS jokes.

        <p data-joke>What is CSS Developers' favorite drink?<br/><code>:root</code> beer.</p>

        <p>I must admit this is a PG version. After sharing this joke online the other day, I got some alternatives that also work for Web Developers:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><code>#C0FFEE</code>
          <li><code>strong .coffee { filter: none }</code>

        <p>Ok, this one does not really have a punchline (do any of them anyway?) But it is true: 
          in CSS, <code>DarkGray</code> is lighter than <code>Gray</code>. Which is interestingly annoying. Another weird fact 
          about CSS: the <code>bolder</code> font-weight can be lighter than the <code>bold</code> font weight. Because... CSS?</p>

        of the lefty-loosey-righty-tighty.js library, and the latest MacBook Pro to handle 
        everything. The resulting JS file will be 8MB and only change the light bulb if the

        <h2>Floating on air</h2>
        <p>
          I get it. I went through my "build site layouts using float" phase as a Web Developer (mainly because it was 
          the only option back then), and now I use Flexbox and Grid. But that doesn't mean that I stopped using the 
          float property! I just don't use it for laying out content, as I don't use <code>&lt;table&gt;</code> for that 
          either (and I'm guilty of using it in the past too).
        </p>
        <p>
          Using float for laying out content is bad, but that doesn't mean it shouldn't be used at all. Unfortunately, 
          there seems to be a misguided "anti-float" movement among new developers who seem to think that using float is 
          bad even for proper situations. Nothing farther from the truth.
        </p>
        <p>
          Float can be convenient to have an image with text wrapping around it. Or maybe a quote taken out of the main 
          text, which can achieve a cool effect, too. So don't just discard it and learn it as another tool in your belt.
        </p>
        <p>
          So remember: use float for aligning and wrapping content, just don't use it for building the structure and 
          layout of your websites :)

        <h2>Order, please... or not?</h2>
        <p>
          It's a new week, and it's a new comic. This time, it goes "back to the roots," as I wanted, and it is more related 
          to a CSS property: order. The CSS code user in the comic is also in the code that generates it.
        </p>
        <p>
          The books in the first panel have different order values, but in the third panel, I applied an "order: unset" that puts 
          all the books back in their original order—which is part of the pun. It makes no sense that unsetting the order puts 
          the content in order.
        </p>
        <h3>Tailwind... again!</h3>
        <p>
          While I poke fun at Tailwind again with the title of the book series, this is an example of where Tailwind would be 
          convenient.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let me explain: I've been drawing these comics that look similar because they are a copy-paste of each other. Sometimes, I 
          forget to remove some of the previous code, which "pollutes" the CSS code. If I used a utility-first CSS library to 
          generate the comics, it would be cleaner and friendlier (not the HTML, though).
        </p>
        <p>
          I already created a utility-class for the Batman comics... maybe I should do the same for this one, considering that
          it's becoming an usual comic.
        </p>
        <h3>The "...or not?" part of the title</h3>
        <p>
          While using the <code>order</code> property may seem like a great idea in some cases, it needs to be used with caution as it may negatively 
          impact the page's accessibility. <b>People usually expect the visual order to be the actual order of the elements</b>. Playing with 
          the order may confuse some users, especially keyboard users, who may notice how the cursor jumps all around the place.
        </p>
        <p>
          So remember: <code>order</code> can be really fun and really powerful. But with great power comes great responsibility. Don't break the site!

        <h2>CSS Infinity... and beyond!</h2>
        <p>
          I was going to write an article about <code>infinity</code> and the different CSS constants (<code>pi</code> and <code>e</code>) 
          that were <em>recently</em> added to the CSS standard... but work and other personal events prevented me from writing anything decent
          related to <a href="/comics/136">today's comic</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          So instead, I leave you here with some interesting resources to learn more about <code>infinity</code> and the other constants:

        </ul>
        <p>
          One thing that I find <del>silly</del> interesting, is that they cannot be used by themselves. They can only be used inside of
          a math function (such as <code>calc()</code> or <code>max()</code>), which triggered me to create another <del>silly</del> supercool meme:
        </p>
        <figure style="max-width: 80ch">
          <img src="./images/infinity-meme.png" alt="Geordi La Forge Meme: a black man wearing a Star Trek uniform with long goggles (that have the text CSS added to them for the meme). First, he has a hand out like asking to stop, next to the CSS code z-index: infinity. Below, he is half smiling and pointing in acceptance to the CSS code z-index:calc(infinity * 1)" />
          <figcaption>CSS and Star Trek. What more can a person wish for?</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          And that's it for today. As a site update, I am preparing the comics for the next few weeks. They will be more "software development" focused
          than CSS <em>per se</em>. But I am sure you'll enjoy them (or I sure hope so).

          <a href="/comics/135">Today's comic</a> is one of those that I really like. They can be easily
          tweaked to generate different alternatives in seconds. For example, here's a version mocking
          TailwindCSS (because, why not?):

          <figcaption>Alternative 1: Tailwind</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>And here another is mocking the PR-Developer relationship:</p>
        <figure style="max-width: 80ch">
          <img src="/comics/135/dungeon-alt-1.png" alt="cartoon with three men hang chained in a dungeon. Two look sad, one looks happy. One of the sad ones says 'he used to be a web developer. he says this is 1,000 times better than dealing with Tailwind'" />
          <figcaption>Alternative 2: Developers vs. PMs</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>And it can go the other way around, too!</p>
        <figure style="max-width: 80ch">
          <img src="/comics/135/dungeon-alt-2.png" alt="cartoon with three men hang chained in a dungeon. Two look sad, one looks happy. One of the sad ones says 'he used to be a web developer. he says this is 1,000 times better than dealing with Tailwind'" />
          <figcaption>Alternative 3: PMs vs. Developers (not the same)</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          The possibilities are endless! Because this cartoon was coded in HTML+CSS, the only thing 
          to change is the text inside a <code>div</code>.

          I like the type of cartoons that can work in many situations. And <a href="/comics/114">today's cartoon</a> is one of 
          them. I've done a few of those lately, such as <a href="/comics/109">Coincidence?</a>, <a href="/comics/111">Nightmare</a>, or

          The end of the joke was Tailwind (an usual target along with JavaScript, which is to be expected from a site that is all 
          about CSS), but it's all in good fun. You have to use what you have to use. And Tailwind is as good or as bad as you 
          choose to do it. It just happens to be popular right now, and has a really vocal (and kind-of sensitive) fandom.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here are some of the alternatives that I considered. Most are related to web accessibility, and some others are a bit 
          poignant. I hope you enjoy them.

      <article id="goldilocks">
        <h2>GoldiloCSS and the Three (Word-)Breaks</h2>
        <p>
          Once upon a time, there was a girl named <a href="/comics/113">GoldiloCSS</a>. She had lived all her life with three bears 
          in a cabin in the forest and wanted to get out and see the world. She knew there was more to life 
          than sleeping and eating porridge and honey all day. 
        </p>
        <p>
          So, GoldiloCSS decided to apply to Med School and prepared her bio (in HTML format for some weird 
          reason that is not important to this story), but she soon found a problem: there were really long 
          words, and they made the lines look terrible and unbalanced. Luckily for her, GoldiloCSS knew CSS 
          (thus her name) and tried the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/word-break"><code>word-break</code></a>
          property.
        </p>
        <p>
          She first used <code>word-break:&nbsp;break-all</code>, but all the words were breaking instead of wrapping if 
          they fit inside the following line. It was tough to read. She looked at the breaks and said, 
          "These breaks are too hard."
        </p>
        <p>
          GoldiloCSS then used<code>word-break:&nbsp;keep-all</code>. This time, the words wrapped correctly if they fit in 
          the following line... but if they didn't, they kept going and overlapping other parts of the bio. 
          That didn't look great either, and she complained, "These breaks are too soft!"
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, GoldiloCSS used <code>word-break:&nbsp;break-word</code>. In this case, if a word fit in the following 
          line, it would wrap, and if it didn't, it would break the word over several lines. She looked at 
          the text, and it was more balanced. She said, "Just right! ...or kind of?" because the long words 
          still looked weird when broken.
        </p>
        <p>
          That day, GoldiloCSS learned several lessons: 
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><code>word-break</code> is a powerful property,</li>
          <li>there are other useful properties for breaking words like hyphens or overflow-wrap,</li>
          <li>the way a word breaks affects readability and accessibility.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          After finishing writing her bio, she was tired. She ate some porridge and slept for a while. That life wasn't that bad after all; she wanted to enjoy it before her next adventure.

        <h2>Riddle: Divtober is over... or is it?</h2>
        <p>This week's cartoon is an interactive joke! My children told me a (terrible) joke the other day:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Who comes in Christmas saying "Oh Oh Oh"?</li>
          <li>Santa Claus walking backwards!</li>

          And as terrible as I am, I decided to create a CSS version of it. As a fun fact: the whole cartoon 
          (interactivity and all) is a single HTML element:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The "<em>Ho Ho Ho!</em>" is linear and radial gradients</li>
          <li>Santa is in the background of the element</li>
          <li>The question is in the <code>::before</code> pseudo-element</li>
          <li>The answer is in the <code>::after</code> pseudo-element</li>
          <li>It uses 3D CSS to make the card flip</li>
          <li>It uses the <code>backface-visibility</code> property to avoid leaking the content we don't want from one side to the other.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Who said Divtober was over?

          It actually was incredibly easy to code, and I tried to make it as accessible as possible (maybe too much): adding semantic
          HTML, each planet has a role of image with an accessible description (with aria-label and title), and same for the crosses 
          and check mark, the table has a caption, the table headings specify their scope and are used as descriptions for the cells...
          It is not perfect, and it may be too much, but it was fun to code it that way.

        <h2>Divtober</h2>
        <p>
          I took a short break from comiCSS to participate in Divtober. Divtober is a coding challenge in which
          developers draw with CSS based on a daily word... but with a catch: they can only use a single element 
          (preferable a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>, thus the name of the challenge).
        </p>
        <p>
          These are the single-div drawings I did for this 2023 Divtober:

        <h2>2023 is CSS year</h2>
        <p>
          This year of 2023 has been fantastic for CSS development. It seemed like JavaScript got all the love in the past, while CSS was relegated to a secondary role, even when it is an essential part of the Web.
        </p>
        <p>
          But 2023 has broken that tendency. We get a new feature definition or browser supporting a new (or old) property almost weekly. And it is incredible... until it won't happen. And it will happen that CSS retakes the back seat, and JavaScript gets back all the attention sooner rather than later.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let's enjoy this time and hope that the tendency slows down progressively so we can keep getting more and more features&mdash;just my two cents.

        <h2>Red Border</h2>
        <p>
           <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafalda" rel="external nofollow">Mafalda</a> was a comic by Argentinian cartoonist
           <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quino" rel="external noreferrer nofollow">Quino</a> that ran in the 1960s and 1970s,
           and that became incredibly popular in the 20<sup>th</sup> century, and well into the 21<sup>st</sup> century.
        </p>
        <p>
          Quino and Mafalda are a great source of inspiration. <a href="/comics/15">I already did a cartoon inspired by Mafalda</a>), and that 
          was the case for <a href="/comics/102">today's comic, too</a>! In the original, the little girl Mafalda looked at the sun
          amazed by how it's the same sun that inspired Pasteur, Bach, Shakespeare... and begs the sun to spread that same inspiration.
        </p>
        <p>
          The idea is the same, but instead of a little girl being amazed by the sun, it's an undefined character/developer amazed by the 
          typical red border that is used at times to debug in CSS (and that was part of <a href="/comics/96">this cartoon</a> or 
          <a href="/comics/98">this other cartoon</a>). This could be the same red border that helped many other good developers learn and grow,
          so the character asks for inspiration to keep growing.
        </p>
        <hr/>
        <p>
          While a red border can be helpful to highlight some issues with CSS (using <code>outline</code> instead of <code>border</code>, so
          the border doesn't mess with the element's size), there are better ways to debug CSS. The Developer Tools on the browsers have
          advanced considerably in the past few years, and provide more tools to analyze each element individually. You inspect the element,
          and the browsers provide information about the rules that apply to each element, which one takes precendence (and why!), etc.
          <a href="https://twitter.com/shadeed9" rel="external nofollow">Ahmad Shadeed</a> wrote a book about how to debug CSS,
          and goes into details and code on the best ways to do it.
        </p>
        <hr/>
        <p>
          A fun fact: I used <code>text-wrap: balance</code> in a CSS art for the first time. It may sound like something silly, but it made 
          it super convenient to balance the text in the panels in a more natural way.

        <h2>If it looks like a duck...</h2>
        <p>The Duck Test implies that the simplest conclusion is most likely correct. It is commonly phrased as "If it looks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck... it probably is a duck."</p>
        <p>This cartoon is half tongue-in-cheek, half serious. Whenever I post a CSS drawing or a comic from comiCSS online, someone says, "CSS should not be used for drawing!"</p>
        <p>Which is technically correct, but how accurate is it? In reality, CSS is a styling language but, for not being a graphic design/graphic/drawing language, it sure does have many features that graphic/drawing languages have: filters, masks, gradients, blend modes, clippings, etc...</p>
        <p>I once drafted an article titled "Could CSS be the future of web imaging?" (which I never published as I never found the power to finish it). In the article, I compared CSS to SVG and Canvas. Many things have happened since I wrote it, and it has become partially outdated (things that happen when you don't finish the article when you should 😓)... maybe I'll finish it one day.</p>
        <p>Going back to the "CSS should not be used for drawing," my answer is this new CSS drawing (I'm getting old and a bit stubborn).</p>

        <h2>ABCs of CSS</h2>
        <p>
          <a href="https://comicss.art/comics/95">This week's comic/cartoon</a> is a "small" project 
          that I had been planning for a while, and it took a little bit longer than expected to 
          complete. It was inspired by a series of cartoons that I saw in Spanish satirical 
          magazine El Jueves.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some of the letters are interactive (like the "R for resize") and some are animated (like 
          the "K for keyframes" or the "Q for quotes"). But that is not really shown on the static
          image version, so they may look a bit weird. You should check the 
          <a href="/comics/95/abc-css.html">live demo</a> linked on the comic page.

          <figcaption>July 10's comic: ABCs of CSS</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          As always, it is coded in HTML and CSS (although this time I did it with SCSS instead of 
          native nesting because I found some issues, then exported the compiled CSS). You can check
          the source code from the demo, and <b>change the font-size of the article on line 27 to make 
          the cartoon larger and easier to read</b>. (If you make it too small, you may hit a bug with 
          mix-blend-mode on Chrome.)
        </p>
        <p>
          I had in mind do the "ABCs of CSS Art" and the "ABCs of HTML", but seeing how much this 
          one took me, maybe I should chill on those a little (although I already started the CSS
          Art one). We'll see how that goes.

        <h2>Coffee Styling Sheet: Coffee as a CSS Color</h2>
        <p>
          They say developers could work only for coffee. I don't think that's true (but maybe 
          not too far either). So this week's cartoon will mix two of my favorite things: coffee 
          and CSS. And in particular, I will focus on CSS colors and how different types of 
          coffees can be represented similarly to CSS colors.
        </p>
        <p>
          We all know about RGB, Hex (also RGB), and HSL (which, funny thing, is also RGB). And 
          new color formats have popped up in the CSS standard: L*a*b*, LCH, CMYK, HWB, OKLCH... 
          So many people have asked me, "<em>Why do we need so many color formats in CSS?</em>" And 
          that is a fair question that I will try to answer with today's cartoon.
        </p>
        <p>
          And I will do it with the help of an existing CSS color function: HWB. Although HWB 
          stands for Hue-Whiteness-Blackness, I modified the letter meanings (just) a little to 
          fit my purpose:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>H = Hot water = water (duh)</li>
          <li>W = Whiteness = milk (foamed, frothed, steamed, etc.)</li>
          <li>B = Blackness = coffee (the cause of, and solution to, all of life's problems.)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          After this long introduction, finally, here's today's cartoon:
        </p>
        <figure style="max-width: 75ch">
          <img src="/comics/87/87-coffee-as-a-css-color-0.webp" alt="Cartoon titled 'Coffee Style Sheet' with different types of coffee described as CSS colors. Black coffee is hwb(0 0 100%), Americano is hwb(50% 0 50%), Lungo is hwb(50% 0 50%), cafe au lait is hwb(0 50% 50%), latte is hwb(0 66% 33%), macchiato is hwb(0 33% 66%), cappuccino is hwb(0 66% 33%), espresso is hwb(0 0 33%), and 'Need more coffee!' is hwb(0 0 0)." />
          <figcaption>I probably should add a description at the top explaining what HWB stands for...</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          Note: I did a <a href="/comics/87/coffee-as-a-css-color.png">secondary 
          version of this cartoon without the description</a> (I find it cleaner).
        </p>
        <p>
          While I like the idea, it is limited: how about if we want a mocha? Mochas have chocolate 
          and hwb() does not have a way to represent chocolate. It's only water, milk, and coffee. 
          With those three basic ingredients, we only get to create the coffees on the infographic 
          and some more (cortado, café bombón, or galão, to name a few). Still, we are missing a ton 
          more: Irish coffee, espresso romano, marochino, etc., and we cannot create them with just 
          water, milk, and coffee.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even for the ones in the cartoon, my newly created hwb() function is not enough. For example, 
          check the cappuccino: it is 66% milk and 33% coffee. It seems misleading that it has the same 
          composition as a latte, but they are not the same: in a cappuccino, the milk is half steamed 
          and half foamed.
        </p>
        <figure style="max-width: 75ch">
          <img src="/blog/images/coffee-as-a-css-color.png" alt="detail of the previous cartoon showing latte and cappuccino along with mocha" />
        </figure>
        <p>
          It would be nicer if we had a different way to express those details. And that's what happens 
          with CSS colors too! We have been using RGB for a long time, but RGB is limited. The 
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-color-4/">CSS Color Module Level 4</a> introduced new ways 
          of writing colors that modernize the web and bring a world of possibilities: Lab, LCH, OKLCH, 
          CMYK, the color() function... and those color spaces offer more options than the standard RGB.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the case of a mocha, we are missing the chocolate (which is not an option in HWB)... so why 
          not use LCH instead?
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>L = Lightness/Leche/Lait/Latte = Milk</li>
          <li>C = Chocolate</li>
          <li>H = Hot coffee</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Now we could use that function to do lch(20% 40% 40%) and get a nice Mocha. And notice how 
          some of the coffees in the chart can be defined with LCH (basically all except the Americano 
          and Lungo.)
        </p>
        <p>
          And same thing happens to the CSS colors: some color functions will allow you to create more 
          vibrant colors than others, and some will be easier for the computer or more straightforward 
          for humans. Some overlap is expected, and that's completely normal. Pick the best color format 
          for your project needs, and enjoy. It is an exciting time to play with CSS colors.

        <h2>How is comiCSS drawn?</h2>
        <p>
          Some people have asked me: "<em>How is comiCSS drawn?</em>" 
          comiCSS cartoons are coded in HTML and CSS, but how? Is it an AI generating
          the code? No... although it would be interesting to see the results.
          An opportunity for further testing. Is it premade things? No, although 
          I must admit that sometimes I copy-paste from previous strips to save time,
          <b>most of the cartoons and comics are coded from scratch</b>.

        <p>
          There are more videos on how the cartoon is drawn. You can see them linked at 
          the bottom of the cartoon/comic. I could put the link in a more visible location 
          so it is more apparent that there is a video with the recorded process.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have to admit that this process is tedious and slow (each cartoon takes 30-60 minutes), 
          and I've been toying with the idea of streamlining the process by working on a mini 
          CSS utility-class library that would allow me to create characters with different 
          expressions, just adding classes. The main issue:
          I still need to develop a fully defined style or set of characters. I could do it easily with
          the <a href="https://comicss.art/comics/1">undefined character from the first comic</a>
          (which is reappearing but not recurring enough to make it its own library?);
          or even with <a href="https://comicss.art/comics/50">the Batman/Robin characters</a>
          (but there are only so many gags that can be done with those two... without 
          getting a cease-and-desist letter from DC.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Creating that library will save me time in the long run and allow me to produce comics 
          faster, but the characters may not be polished enough for it. So we'll see how it goes.

        <h2>Flex-Wrapping</h2>
        <p>
          Rap battling (or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_rap">battle rap</a>) is a type of rap performance in which 
          two or more rappers sing against each other (generally including some insults/attacks). <a href="/comics/77">Today's comic</a> 
          plays with the homophones Rap and Wrap to make a silly joke with Flexbox and the
          <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex-wrap"><code>flex-wrap</code> property</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          A flex container will lay out the content in a single line by default. This may be Ok, but if the items' size exceeds the 
          container, they will be squeezed or they will overflow. So instead, we may want to get the content into multiple lines. 
          This is where <code>flex-wrap</code> comes into action.
        </p>
        <p>
          This property defines if a flex container will be single-line or multi-line (depending on the amount and size of the flex items),
          and in the case of multi-line, it defines how the items will be stacked after wrapping.
        </p>
        <p>
          <code>flex-wrap</code> has three main values:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><code>nowrap</code>: the items will not wrap, instead they will overflow the parent. (This is the default value.)</li>
          <li><code>wrap</code>: the items will wrap instead of overflowing the flex container. They will stack from cross-start to cross-end.</li>
          <li><code>wrap-reverse</code>: the items will wrap instead of overflowing the flex container. They will stack from cross-end to cross-start.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The cross-start and cross-end part may sound complicated, but it is easier than what it sounds. It depends on the direction of
          the flex: if the direction is horizontal ("row"), then the wrapped elements will stack vertically (in rows); and if the direction is 
          vertical ("column"), the wrapped elements will stack horizontally (in columns).
        </p>
        <p>
          Let's check an example with a flex container with 5 items with a defined width. By default, the value of <code>flex-wrap</code> is "nowrap", 
          so the flex items will overflow the container (I put it as an image to avoid the annoying horizontal overflow it would create):
        </p>
        <p>
          <img src="./images/flex-wrap-demo.png" alt="a box with 5 numbered boxes inside, the last of them overflows the container" />
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, if we change the code to set a value of "wrap" for <code>flex-wrap</code>, when the flex items would overflow the container, 
          they wrap into a new row instead (live demo):
        </p>
        <style>
          p.flex-demo-div {
            background: #f002;
            padding: 10px;
            max-width: min(100%, 640px);
            display: flex;
            gap: 10px;
            box-sizing: border-box;
            flex-direction: row;
            flex-wrap: wrap;
            align-content: flex-start;
          }
          span.flex-demo-item {
            font-family: Helvetica, arial, sans-serif;
            font-size: 25px;
            max-width: 200px;
            height: 50px;
            display: grid;
            place-items: center;
            color: #fff;
            min-width: 125px;
            width: 40%;
          }
          /* Figma colors in a different order? Just a coincidence ;) ;) */
          span.flex-demo-item:nth-child(1) { background: #eb4b1b; }
          span.flex-demo-item:nth-child(2) { background: #9c56f6; }
          span.flex-demo-item:nth-child(3) { background: #f86e5f; }
          span.flex-demo-item:nth-child(4) { background: #0fc97e; }
          span.flex-demo-item:nth-child(5) { background: #1bb5f6; }
        </style>
        <p class="flex-demo-div">
          <span class="flex-demo-item">1</span>
          <span class="flex-demo-item">2</span>
          <span class="flex-demo-item">3</span>
          <span class="flex-demo-item">4</span>
          <span class="flex-demo-item">5</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          But if we set <code>flex-wrap</code> to "wrap-reverse", then the direction of the wrapping is the opposite: instead of
          getting into a new row, the wrapped elements <em>push</em> the others into a new row.
        </p>
        <p class="flex-demo-div" style="flex-wrap: wrap-reverse;">
          <span class="flex-demo-item">1</span>
          <span class="flex-demo-item">2</span>
          <span class="flex-demo-item">3</span>
          <span class="flex-demo-item">4</span>
          <span class="flex-demo-item">5</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          One last example with the <code>flex-direction</code> set to "column." In this case, the elements organize vertically
          in columns, so when they wrap, they do it in columns instead of rows:
        </p>
        <p class="flex-demo-div" style="flex-direction: column; max-height: 230px;">
          <span class="flex-demo-item">1</span>
          <span class="flex-demo-item">2</span>
          <span class="flex-demo-item">3</span>
          <span class="flex-demo-item">4</span>
          <span class="flex-demo-item">5</span>
        </p>

        <h2>An Apple A Day Alternative</h2>
        <p>
          They say an apple a day keeps the doctor away... But does that apply to web development and CSS, too? Today's cartoon 
          tried to answer that question. I also coded an alternative version, a little bit more educational, highlighting the 
          parts of the box model using the same drawing:
        </p>
        <figure style="max-width: 75ch">
          <img src="/comics/74/an-apple-a-day-large-1.webp" alt="A man in the position of the lotus with his personal space marked with a dashed line, a doctor is far away unable to reach the person. The person is labelled 'content', the space between the person and the dashed line is labelled 'padding', the dashed line is labelled 'border', the space between the dashed line and the doctor is labelled 'margin'." />
          <figcaption>The box model explained with a cartoon?</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          Hopefully, it is clear. Although I must admit, the dashed line marking the personal space is a bit weird and it can 
          be confusing (as it may seem like it's a force-field and the margin is actually between the person and the border).

      <article id="keyboard-trap-vs-focus-trap">
        <h2>Keyboard Trap vs. Focus Trap</h2>
        <p>
          A keyboard trap is a bad UI pattern in which a user can get into a component or element of our application using the keyboard, 
          but it is impossible getting out of it just by using the keyboard. Not to be confused with a focus trap, which is basically 
          the same, but with a keyboard exit (it may be a close button, or pressing Esc, or something like that.)
        </p>
        <p>
          As you may imagine, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/keyboard-operation-trapping.html" rel="external nofollow noreferrer">a 
          keyboard trap is a HUGE accessibility issue</a>. In contrast, a focus trap can be extremely helpful and positive for usability 
          and accessibility (e.g., a modal in which the focus is trapped until the user presses a button.)
        </p>
        <p>
          I've had the idea of drawing a trap for keyboards for a while, but I didn't know if it would be clear what it was. I'm still 
          not 100% convinced about it. I like the idea, but I'm not 100% sold on this implementation. I settled for this text 
          (<a href="/comics/13">which may remind of a previous comic strip</a>), but before I considered another option about testing and 
          trying to catch keyboards with a trap. I discarded that option because if felt too "technical" and not too good of an idea.

        <h2>The Pomodorito Technique</h2>
        <p>You may have heard about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique" rel="external noreferrer nofollow">Pomodoro Technique</a>, <strong>a time management method that consists of repeating work and break intervals</strong> to help keep focus while getting some needed rest. It is pretty popular in the US among tech employees.</p>
        <p>The origin of the name is funny: the method's creator used a tomato-shaped kitchen timer to control the work/break blocks (Pomodoro means tomato in Italian). So that is why each work block is called a "Pomodoro."</p>
        <p>The method is simple. First, you pick a task and then:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Work for 25 minutes.</li>
          <li>Take a 5&mdash;10 minute break.</li>
          <li>Repeat steps 1&mdash;2 four times.</li>
          <li>Take a more extended break of 20&mdash;30 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>I find this a productive time management method. I follow it often and keep a couple of timers at my desk while I'm working (although they are not tomato-shaped.)</p>
        <h3>The Pomodorito Technique</h3>
        <p>Alternatively to the Pomodoro Technique, I introduce you to the tongue-in-cheek Pomodorito Technique (not Lay's affiliated):</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Eat Doritos for 25 minutes.</li>
          <li>Work for 5 minutes.</li>
          <li>Repeat steps 1&mdash;2 four times.</li>
          <li>Take a more extended break to go to the store and buy more Doritos (you probably ran out at this point).</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Alternatively, if you have a big stash of Doritos at home, you may use step 4 to take a nap. All that eating is exhausting, and some nice sleep will make digestion easier.</p>

          <figcaption>Not Lay's affiliated</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>While the Pomodorito Technique is more of a joke, it may be a good burnout index. <strong>If you find yourself trying the Pomodoro Technique but quickly spiral into the Pomodorito Technique, it may be about time to take some vacation... or start looking for a new job!</strong></p>

        <h2>Four combinators walk into a bar...</h2>
        <p>
          Today's comic strip is about <b>CSS combinators</b> (and the universal selector). But, what are they? 
          A CSS combinator is something that, combined with the selectors, gives them a relationship.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are five CSS combinators (but one is at risk of not making the cut to the standard):
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">
            <b>Descendant combinator (<code>&nbsp;</code>)</b>: indicates that the second element is a descendant (at any level) of the first one.
            <!-- <br/>
            For example, <code>p span</code>: will select all the <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> inside a <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>. -->
          </li>
          <li style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">
            <b>Child combinator (<code>&gt;</code>)</b>: indicates that the second element is a direct descendant (first level only) of the first one.
            <!-- <br/>
            For example, <code>p &gt; span</code>: will select all the <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> that are directly inside the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>.
            But if the <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> is say inside a <code>&lt;button&gt;</code>, then it won't select it, because the direct descendant is the button. -->
          </li>
          <li style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">
            <b>Adjacent sibling combinator (<code>+</code>)</b>: indicates that the second element follows the first one directly in the code (first sibling).
            <!-- <br/>
            For example, <code>p &gt; span</code>: will select all the <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> that are directly inside the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>.
            But if the <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> is say inside a <code>&lt;button&gt;</code>, then it won't select it, because the direct descendant is the button. -->
          </li>
          <li style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">
            <b>General sibling combinator (<code>~</code>)</b>: indicates that the second element follows the first one in the code (any sibling as long as it's after the first element).
            <!-- <br/>
            For example, <code>p &gt; span</code>: will select all the <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> that are directly inside the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>.
            But if the <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> is say inside a <code>&lt;button&gt;</code>, then it won't select it, because the direct descendant is the button. -->
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Column combinator (<code>||</code>)</b>: indicates that the second element is in the same column specified as the first element (this combinator is experimental and at risk of being removed)
            <!-- <br/>
            For example, <code>p &gt; span</code>: will select all the <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> that are directly inside the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>.
            But if the <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> is say inside a <code>&lt;button&gt;</code>, then it won't select it, because the direct descendant is the button. -->
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The <b>universal selector</b> (<code>*</code>) selects everything (and that's why everyone in the bar cheers when the next round is on the universal selector.)</p>
        <p>This was just a simple introduction to the CSS combinators. For more information, check the following MDN resources:</p>

        <p>
          "Soup is to Childhood what Communism is to Democracy!" is a political message (cartoons can/should be 
          political at times) that could have different interpretations depending on the perspective.
        </p> 
        <p>
          Based on it, <a href="/comics/15">I drew something simple</a>. And because it uses CSS variables (custom 
          properties), it is easy to change the colors to something different:

          But I liked the black-and-white version betters, so I published that one. Also, I added more details 
          before publishing it on Monday (the table and t-shirt could use some extras).

          Here is a video of how this cartoon was drawn from scratch to its (almost) final form:

        <h2>Accent Color</h2>
        <p>
          Today's comicstrip is about <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/accent-color" rel="external noreferrer nofollow"><code>accent-color</code></a>, 
          so let's talk about it on today's blog post.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the comic strip indicates, <code>accent-color</code> has nothing to do with the ability to write colors in 
          different languages. What it does, when supported &mdash;and it is widely supported now&mdash;, is allowing 
          setting up the "primary color" for some HTML elements and form controls. 
        </p>
        <p>
          This CSS property allows for a little standardization of the styles. In the past, each browser would style the HTML elements 
          differently (they still do); but now, developers have some control over how they will be displayed (at least, 
          on the color.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Browsers allow to set up an <code>accent-color</code> in the following HTML elements:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Checkboxes (<code>&lt;input type="checkbox" /&gt;</code>)</li>
          <li>Radio buttons (<code>&lt;input type="radio" /&gt;</code>)</li>
          <li>Range inputs (<code>&lt;input type="range" /&gt;</code>)</li>
          <li>Progress bars (<code>&lt;progress /&gt;</code>)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>...So it begins</h2>
        <p>
          I've been doing CSS art for a while already. So it was a matter of time that I combined the CSS art hobby with something I 
          also enjoy, like graphic novels, comic books, or comic strips.
        </p>
        <p>
          This website is my first attempt at building a place to put all the CSS cartoons I came up with and create an actual series. 
          Hopefully, the comic strips will come weekly, but that will depend on many factors.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have to thank <a href="https://twitter.com/challengescss" rel="external noreferrer nofollow">Temani Afif</a> for
          the encouragement to put this site together... and for coming up with the name <span class="sitename">comi<span>CSS</span></span>. 
          I probably would have delayed the creation of this website until I got a good name, and he came up with a great one in no time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let's begin. <em>Ad astra!</em>
